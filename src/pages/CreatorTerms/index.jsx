          In our pursuit of enhancing our Services, these Terms may undergo
          changes to align with the evolving nature of our offerings. We reserve
          the right to modify the Terms at any time, and if we do, we will

        <p>
          Should you disagree with the revised Terms, you have the option to
          reject them. However, this would mean you cannot continue to use the
          Services. Your use of the Services post any effective change in the
          Terms indicates your agreement to all the modifications.
        </p>

        <p>

          amendment or modification to these Terms will be effective unless in

        <h4>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act</h4>
        <p>
          The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) mandates that

          collected personal information from a child under 13 years of age, we
          will promptly delete that information. If you believe that a child
          under 13 years of age may have provided us personal information,
          please contact us at support@sharely.fun.
