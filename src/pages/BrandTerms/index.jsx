        </p>

        <h4>Can I refer other users?</h4>
        <p>
          Yes, sharely allows users to refer others to the Services. Referrers
          may be eligible for rewards or incentives for referring individuals or
          entities (Referees) who are not current customers of sharely or
          registered users of the Services. The Referrer can make multiple
          referrals, and there is generally no limit to the cumulative rewards
          unless otherwise indicated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Referrers receive the stated reward or incentive for each Referee who
          completes the required action specified in the referral offer. All
          Referees must be first-time recipients of the offer, and multiple
          referrals to the same individual or entity are disregarded.

          sharely reserves the right to modify or terminate referral offers at
          any time and may revoke the offer from Referrer and Referee at its
          discretion. If sharely determines that Referrer or Referee is
          attempting to obtain unfair advantage or violate the terms of the
          offer, sharely reserves the right to revoke rewards or incentives.
        </p>

        <h4>Warranty Disclaimer:</h4>
        <p>

        <p>
          To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, the sharely Parties
          will not be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, punitive, or
          consequential damages. The liability is limited to the greater of one

          with the Services in the twelve (12) month period preceding the claim.

        </p>

        <h4>Arbitration Agreement:</h4>

          Disputes arising from these Terms will be resolved through binding
          arbitration in Miami, Florida, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined
          Arbitration Rules. Both parties waive their rights to go to court and
          have a trial in front of a judge or jury. The waiver of class or
          consolidated actions is emphasized, and claims must be arbitrated or
          litigated on an individual basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have the right to opt out of the arbitration agreement within
          thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms by sending a written
          notice to sharely. If you opt-out or in cases where the arbitration
          agreement doesn't apply, disputes may be resolved in court in Miami,
          Florida.
        </p>

        <h4>Miscellaneous:</h4>
        <p>
          Users are responsible for taxes associated with their activity in
          connection with the Services. These Terms represent the complete and
          exclusive understanding between you and sharely, superseding all
          previous agreements. These Terms are governed by the laws of the State
          of Delaware.
        </p>
